Lyx Notebook is a program which allows the word processor Lyx to be used as a
code-evaluating notebook (similar to Mathematica notebooks or the Sage
notebook).  

It only works with interactive, interpreted languages.  The currently-supported
languages are Python 2, Python 3, Sage, Scala, R, and Bash.  There are custom
insets for code cells and output cells.  When a cell is evaluated the output is
sent to the output cell.  The program keeps interpreter processes running,
maintaining their state.  The Listings package is used to highlight the code in
the code cells in the Latex-formatted printable output.

See the file doc/lyxNotebookDocs.pdf for an overview, details of the install
procedure, descriptions of all the available commands, and customization
options.  There are example Lyx files in the examples directory.  To install,
change directories to the Lyx Notebook source directory (in its final
location), go to the subdirectory lyxNotebook, and run:

   ./install.py &

This program only works on Linux systems, and has only been tested recently on
Ubuntu distributions.  Most of the testing has been with Python 2 code cells.
