"""

This file only contains the keymap for Lyx Notebook.  The keys can be
arbitrarily set by changing them from this file (though, of course, collisions
with other key mappings and convenience should be considered).

Any key which is bound to a Lyx Notebook function should also be bound to the
Lyx LFUN "server-notify" in the Lyx `.bind` file (which the install program creates
as `lyxNotebookKeyBindings.bind` in the user's Lyx home directory)!

To modify a key mapping in this file, simply change the string (or the None value)
in the first component of a 2-tuple in the list `all_commands_and_keymap` below.
The associated command strings in the second component of the 2-tuples should
not be changed at all, or bugs will occur.

The string names which are used for the keys must be the same as the string
names which are reported by the Lyx server-notify LFUN.  To find the name for a
key, press it in Lyx while looking at the status-bar on the lower left.  The
name of the key will briefly appear (except in some cases when it is already
bound to something).  That is the string which should be used.  In particular,
the prefixes "Shift+", "Alt+", and "Control+" are used instead of the shorter
forms "S-", "M-", and "C-" which are used in the Lyx .bind file.

To avoid collisions with the "usual" mappings, see, e.g.,
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_keyboard_shortcuts
for which keys are used by the OS.  Beware alt-F4 in KDE, close window.  The
default LyX bindings can be found in whatever .bind file is being used, such
as `cua.bind` in the Lyx system (try "locate cua.bind" on the command line).

Note that the F9 and F10 keys are unavailable in KDE: they are the window walk
forward/backward keys.
